# Custom React Template

Hiya! I made this for fun if I ever get bored in vite or nextjs

1. Run npm install in the cli to install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. You can use bun start to run the project
```bash
bun start
```

You can customize this template to your liking that's all for now, happy coding!
